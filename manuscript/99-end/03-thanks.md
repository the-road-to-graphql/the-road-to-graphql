## Thank You

Foremost, I want to thank you for reading the book or taking the full blown course. My biggest hope is that you had a great learning experience with the material. You should feel empowered now to build your own application that uses any kind of state management. Reach out to me, if you have any kind of feedback. I strive to go more in the direction of education which is why I depend on your feedback.

You can visit [my website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) to find more topics about software and web development. If you like to get any updates, feel free to [subscribe to them](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch). The updates will only be quality content and never spam. In addition, I can recommend to read again about the further learning paths from one of the recent chapters. Otherwise grab a friend of yours or join the Slack Group to teach others about state management.

In the end, if you liked the learning experience, I hope you will recommend the book to other people. Share it if you liked it. Just think about people in your life who want to learn more about this topic, regardless of using React, React Native, Angular or Vue, and share the book with them. I believe, developers need to align on this topic in order to get to the next level of modern applications.

Thank you for reading the book.
Robin
