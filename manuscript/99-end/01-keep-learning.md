## Never stop Learning

The Learning Pyramid shows the relation between retention rates and mental activities, proving usable data for both teaching and learning. It is one of the most effective ways to measure effective lessons since I started teaching programming. This is how typical mental activities break down according to retention rates:

* **5% Lecture**
* **10% Reading** 
* **20% Audiovisual** 
* **30% Demonstration** 
* **50% Discussion** (FYI: There is a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/))
* **75% Practice by Doing** 
* **90% Teach Others** (see: the Road to Learn React Slack group mentioned above)

In the beginning of the book, I mentioned that no one masters programming by reading a book, and throughout I have emphasized application of the lessons is the best way to retain them. The last item in the pyramid that has the biggest return of investment: teaching Others. I had the same experience when I started blogging about my experiences in web development, answered questions on Quora, Reddit, Slack Overflow, and wrote books. Teaching others forces you to dive deeper into topics, so you learn about the nuances because you want to teach them the right way. Think of friends, coworkers, or online peers from Stack Overflow or Reddit who are keen to learn about state management in modern applications with React, Redux, and MobX. Schedule a get-together, and teach them state management in modern applications with React. Both mentor and student will grow from the experience.
