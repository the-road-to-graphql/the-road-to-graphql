# Final Thoughts

The last chapters of this book are to inspire you to apply what you've learned. It provides further learning paths, a life hack to improve your learning experience, and other people in the React and Redux ecosystems to follow for inspiration.

So far, the book has taught you different approaches to state management. Whether you are using React, an alternative view layer library, or a sophisticated SPA library, most come with a built-in solution for local state. The book has shown you React's local state management and demonstrated approaches to scale it in plain React applications. Afterward, you learned extensively about Redux as a sophisticated state management library that can be combined with any view layer or SPA library. The book has taught you how to use it in React applications, too. As alternative to Redux, you read about MobX as sophisticated state management library. It comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Redux and MobX give you two different approaches to opt-in state management. You should always consider local state management solutions to keep your state coupled to components instead of exposing it in the global state.

## Further Learning Paths

 While reading the chapters, you adapted applications to apply advanced techniques, tools, and features. Perhaps you followed all of the practical chapters closely, but that's not the end. Be creative and challenge yourself by implementing these tools in your own applications. I am curious what you come up with, so don't hesitate to reach out to me.

The book uses React as its view layer, but React is not mandatory for Redux or MobX. Other view layer libraries or even SPA frameworks have their own local state management, though they can be used with Redux or MobX. You can substitute the React view layer with your own solution to build modern applications. My other book, [The Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/), teaches the fundamentals of plain React by building a larger application that consumes an external REST API. The books are made to complement one another.

I always advocate that [learning with APIs is empowering](https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/), so I teach them whenever I cover the basics. Now it's up to you to build your own applications to deepen your understanding of the tools and techniques at your disposal. You can even build your own SoundCloud Client in React and Redux that consumes the SoundCloud API. There are many platforms like Reddit, Twitter or Yelp that expose their REST APIs. Choose one of these and build a client application on top of it. After you display some of their RESTful data, come up with creative features to expand functionality. Again, you can always reach out to me to showcase your applications. I am curious what you will build after you read the book. Another challenge is to build your own state management solution from scratch. Redux is not a large library. Your first attempt could be to duplicate its functionality, and you could eventually introduce a concept that is embraced by your state management library. 

[Redux is an open source library](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), so it is possible for you to contribute to the project. It can be intimidating to contribute in open source, but it can also be a great return on investment. You can start by helping out with the documentation, or by answering questions in GitHub issues. You could immediately find yourself in a great community of contributors, and then go beyond it and try to solve bug issues, review pull requests, or help on other platforms like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/). By contributing to the topic and giving back to the community, your own understanding of the subject grows as well.

Keep yourself educated in this area by reading articles about it. I write a lot about these topics on my personal website. One of my articles give [a list of useful tips to learn React and Redux](https://www.robinwieruch.de/tips-to-learn-react-redux/) that many find useful. A couple external resources are the repositories by Mark Erikson: [react-redux-links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links) and [redux-ecosystem-links](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links). 

If you want to go beyond Redux, give [Relay Modern](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/relay-modern.html) or [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) a shot. Both allow you to build [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)-consuming client applications. By using Relay Modern or Apollo Client, you can give your application state management in the client API layer instead of the application layer. Similar to the platforms that expose REST APIs, you can look up platforms that expose a GraphQL API. In your own client application, you can also use Relay Modern to consume the API.
