## Requirements

To get the most out of this book, you should be familiar with the basics of web development, which includes knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-learn-framework/) mentions several things that should be kinda familiar regarding JavaScript before you start to read this book. You will also need to be familiar with the term API, which I explained [here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/), because APIs are used frequently for the applications in this book.

### Editor and Terminal

For the development environment, use a terminal/command line tool or an IDE with an integrated terminal. [Follow my setup guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/) if you're unsure about which tools to use. The guide is set up for MacOS users, but you can find a Windows setup guide there as well.

### Node and NPM

[Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) should be installed, as they will run the applications we build and manage their libraries. You will install external node packages via npm (node package manager) during these tutorials, either as libraries or entire frameworks. You can verify which node and npm versions you have in the command line:

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
node --version
*v10.11.0
npm --version
*v6.5.0
~~~~~~~~

These are the versions used for this publication. If you don't see output in your terminal, you will need to install node and npm. 

### React

My other book, The Road to learn React, teaches the fundamentals about React, like how to make the transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. It is available for free, and after having read it, you should possess all the understanding necessary to work with the applications from this book.
